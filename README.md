Based on the code changes and commit messages in the pull request, here is a summary of the updates made:

1. **.github/workflows/update_readme.yaml**:
   - Added a step to extract PR Number and Commit SHA from the GitHub event context.
   - Added a step to generate an updated README using a Python script (`main.py`).
   - Environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `REPO_PATH`, `PR_NUMBER`, and `COMMIT_SHA` are passed to the Python script.

2. **.gitignore**:
   - Added `venv` to the `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment directory.

3. **requirements.txt**:
   - Updated dependencies versions, added new dependencies like `jsonpatch`, `langchain-core`, `langchain-openai`, `langsmith`, `orjson`, `packaging`, `pydantic`, `pydantic_core`, `PyYAML`, `regex`, `tenacity`, and `tiktoken`.

4. **utility.py**:
   - Updated the `format_data_for_openai` and `call_openai` functions to use `langchain_openai` and added error handling for OpenAI API calls.
   - Updated the `update_readme_and_create_pr` function to submit updated README content as a PR in a new branch with a relevant commit message and PR title.

5. **Commit Message**:
   - The commit message indicated updating the README to include that GPT-3.5 is the model being used to generate READMEs.

6. **Current README Content**:
   - The existing README file content is provided for reference.

Based on the updates and the provided README content, the README file likely needs to be updated to reflect the changes made in the code and to include information about using GPT-3.5 for generating README files. The Python script in the workflow likely generates an updated README based on the code changes and commit messages.
